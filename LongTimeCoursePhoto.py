## Functions and code to creat the long time course figures for distraction paper

# Step 1 - run the all functions file 
# Step 2 - run the Ch4_analysis_licking and Ch4_analysis_distraction files 
# Step 3 - change the snipper function to make longer snips and add this to this file
# Step 4 - copy over only the code that is needed from the licking and distraciton file 
#        - to make the long time course figures 

#! ! ! Decide if you are going to use data from one representative rats or all of the animals 
        # Check back to MMIN18 and see whether you used group or individual data 
        # Maybe only need the blue signal or maybe also violet is useful 

# Step 5 - make and save long timecourse figures 
        
        
# Step 6 - subset the required data for the barscatter plots, decide which info is important 
        
# Step 7 - calculate peaks within time region and look at these statistically 
        
        
# Step 8 - check which figures and statistics from thesis / and corrections (time bins)
#        - will be used

# Step 9 - make barscatter of 'probability' of distraction in 10 min time bins 
#        - averaged for all of the rats (make the percent for each and then average)
#        - show statistically the lack of habituaiton effect within the session 
        
        

## Step 10 - is it possible to make barscatters for average post distraction pauses 
#          - or other measure median then bin these into 10 mins as with percent distracted?
